# Car-Price-Prediction
Machine learning model which can predict the Price of a car, Python.

This project is written in python and uses following libraries:
1. NumPy
2. pandas
3. seaborn
4. sklearn
5. Matplotlib
6. catboost.

In this project, I tried linear regression, Nearest Neighbors Regression, Decision Tree Regression from sklearn module and CatBoost Regression from catBoost module to build model which will be used to predict resale value of cars. The dataset used in the model is from Kaggle.com.
